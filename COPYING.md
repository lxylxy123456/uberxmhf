This repository includes code from multiple sources, under 
different licenses including the top-level LICENSE. 
The authoritative licenses and conditions 
are in file-headers and notices in the individual sub-folders 
and files. All the licenses and notices must be reproduced
any source or binary-only distribution.
(i.e., typical BSD-style requirement):


Our view on licensing
=====================

Our preference is for permissive licenses allowing binary
distribution, though possibly requiring attribution. This is motivated
by several factors:

1. This project is partially sponsored with government funding. For
this reason it makes sense to make it a "public good" with very few
restrictions.

2. This project is partially sponsored by independent corporations. We
would like them to be able to view and use the code without fear of
legal entanglements.

3. We believe that placing fewer restrictions on this code will help
it be used more widely and have greater impact.

For these reasons, code generated specifically for this project is
placed under a BSD-style license, as in the top-level LICENSE file.

We have attempted to minimize the incorporation of third party code
that would place additional restrictions on how our code is used.  We
currently use some GPL code, though we continue to seek non-GPL
alternatives. See below for more details.

Unmodified distribution
=======================

All software in this repository is under some form of open source
license. You are free to use and distribute the unmodified source code.

Derived works
=============

Most of the source licenses have some form of attribution clause
requiring that any modifications leave the copyright and license
information place, and that distributed binaries be accompanied with
that copyright and license information.

We attempt to avoid GPL-style licenses requiring that derived works
also be under GPL-style licenses. However, there is currently some GPL
code in this repository. See below.

Binary distribution
===================

There is currently some GPL-licensed code in this repository. See below.

GPL status of sub-folders
==========================

./uxmhf/xmhf-uobjs/xc_newlog uberobject uses some GPL code for E1000 network hardware
interactions.

./xmhf/ uses some GPL code as documented in ./xmhf/COPYING.md
