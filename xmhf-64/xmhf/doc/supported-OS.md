In principle, any guest operating system should be supported so

* Uses 'normal' 32-bit page tables. PAE is also supported on
  AMD. 64-bit is not yet supported.

The following guest OSes are known to work:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with kernel 3.2.0-27-generic and below
* Windows XP
* Windows Server 2003
* Ubuntu 10.04
