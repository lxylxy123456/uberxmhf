Lockdown Verifier Firmware Implementation
on DS2148WZ ARM development board

Author: Amit Vasudevan (amitvasudevan@acm.org)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: Operating environment for this writing was 
Ubuntu 10.04/10.10. 

Build and Install Instructions
==============================

1. install lpc21isp flash programming utility from:
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/lpc21isp
  
   note: ensure lpc21isp accessible via system PATH
   
2. install GNU ARM toolchain v3.4.3 from:
   http://www.gnuarm.com
	
   note: ensure gnuarm-3.4.3/bin is in system PATH
   
3. cd into ds2148wz and issue:
   
   make
   
   if all goes well, you should get ldnverifiermag.hex
   
   
4. locate the "programming jumper" on the dsw2148wz board. this is
	a black switch just next to the serial port on the verifier with
	a "Load ->" marked on the board. Flip the switch to the 
	side of the ->. This will put the bootloader on the board to 
	"program mode" and will allow you to flash a new firmware.

5. connect the verifier to a USB port and connect the serial port
   on the verifier to an available COM port on the host
	
6. install the firmware 
   make installfirmware
   
   if all goes well, firmware download finished message appears.
   
7. switch the "programming jumper" to the opposite direction of
  the "Load ->" marked on the board.
