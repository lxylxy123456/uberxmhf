Module Name:

        SendRCV.C
        
Abstract:

    This module contains miniport functions for handling Send & Receive
    packets and other helper routines called by these miniport functions.

    In order to excercise the send and receive code path of this driver, 
    you should install more than one instance of the miniport. If there 
    is only one instance installed, the driver throws the send packet on
    the floor and completes the send successfully. If there are more 
    instances present, it indicates the incoming send packet to the other
    instances. For example, if there 3 instances: A, B, & C installed. 
    Packets coming in for A instance would be indicated to B & C; packets 
    coming into B would be indicated to C, & A; and packets coming to C 
    would be indicated to A & B.

Routine Description:

    Send Packet Array handler. Called by NDIS whenever a protocol
    bound to our miniport sends one or more packets.

    The input packet descriptor pointers have been ordered according 
    to the order in which the packets should be sent over the network 
    by the protocol driver that set up the packet array. The NDIS 
    library preserves the protocol-determined ordering when it submits
    each packet array to MiniportSendPackets

    As a deserialized driver, we are responsible for holding incoming send 
    packets in our internal queue until they can be transmitted over the 
    network and for preserving the protocol-determined ordering of packet
    descriptors incoming to its MiniportSendPackets function. 
    A deserialized miniport driver must complete each incoming send packet
    with NdisMSendComplete, and it cannot call NdisMSendResourcesAvailable. 

    Runs at IRQL <= DISPATCH_LEVEL

Routine Description:

    This routines checks to see whether the packet can be accepted

Arguments:

    Adapter    - pointer to the adapter structure
    Packet      - pointer to the send packet


Return Value:

    True or False
