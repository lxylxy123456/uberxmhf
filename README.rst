uber eXtensible Micro-Hypervisor Framework (uberXMHF)
=====================================================


Introduction
------------

The uber eXtensible Micro-Hypervisor Framework (uberXMHF) is a formally
verifiable micro-hypervisor framework which forms the foundation for a
new class of (security-oriented) micro-hypervisor based applications
("uberapps") on commodity computing platforms.

uberXMHF currently runs on both x86 (Intel and AMD) and ARM (Raspberry
PI) multi-core hardware virtualized platforms. The framework is capable
of running unmodified legacy multiprocessor capable OSes such as Windows
and Linux.

Visit: http://uberxmhf.org for more information on how to download,
build, install, contribute and get involved.


Documentation
-------------

Documentation sources are within ``docs/`` in reStructuredText (reST)
format and can be browsed using a simple text editor (start at
``docs/index.rst``).

HTML version of the documentation can also be built locally using
``make clean`` followed by ``make docs_html`` within the ``docs/``
folder. Load the resulting ``docs/_build/index.html`` into a browser of
your choice.

Note that you will need a working installation of sphinx to build the
documentation within your development environment. For example, within
Ubuntu/Debian distributions the following will install sphinx:

``sudo apt install python3-pip``
``python3 -m pip install sphinx==2.2.0``
``python3 -m pip install sphinx-jsondomain==0.0.3``

The formatted documentation can be read online at:
http://docs.uberxmhf.org


Software Requirements
---------------------

uberSpark (http://uberspark.org) is used to build and verify security
invariants of uberXMHF.
