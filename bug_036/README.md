# HP cannot boot Windows 10

## Scope
* HP, x64 Windows 10, x86 XMHF
* Cannot testing x86 Windows 10 easily due to bootloader issues
* good: QEMU

## Behavior
See also `bug_027` "Behavior" section, especially `20220109205416`

When booting x64 Windows 10 with x64 QEMU on HP, see different behaviors

Before `bug_027`
* Exception #GP on CPU 4, exception #MC on CPU 0 (`20220109205416`, 1 time)
* No output on serial port after E820 intercepts (3 times)

Before `bug_036`
* No output on serial port after E820 intercepts (1 time)

## Debugging

One suspect is something related to TPM. Windows 10's use of TPM caused
`bug_031`. We may want to hide the TPM from the guest OS.

In git `f0293308f`, we print all intercepts. Can see that CPU 0 stucks after
some int 15h BIOS calls. Serial in `20220116215157`. However, for VMCALL, we
need to read the stack to see actual RIP.

Found a bug about using all bits of RSP in real mode. Should only use 16 bits.
Fixed in `7b6db45be`. In Intel volume 3 "19.1 REAL-ADDRESS MODE":
> A single, 16-bit-wide stack is provided for handling procedure calls and
  invocations of interrupt and exception handlers. This stack is contained in
  the stack segment identified with the SS register. The SP (stack pointer)
  register contains an offset into the stack segment.

Print CS:IP for caller to int 15h. Git `6cd8df3e8`, serial `20220117111803`.
Maybe we should print AX-DX.

Git is `eba84f4bf`, serial `20220117112953`. Not sure what `e80c` means.

### Use of BDA

Currently `_vmx_int15_initializehook()` uses BDA. However, I think the better
way is to use EBDA, similar to GRUB. In GRUB, if use `drivemap -s (hd0) (hd1)`
trice, can see that first 2 entries of E820 map changes from:
```
0x0000000000000000, size=0x000000000009fc00 (1)
0x000000000009fc00, size=0x0000000000000400 (2)
```
to:
```
0x0000000000000000, size=0x000000000009f7b0 (1)
0x000000000009f7b0, size=0x0000000000000850 (2)
```

Likely also need to change BDA `0x40:0x13` and `int $0x12`. Also looks like
GRUB changes `int $0x13`. However, likely low priority bug for now.

### Capture more BIOS calls

In git `8d3e47171`, captured INT 0x10 - 0x1e. QEMU serial in `20220117141508`,
HP serial in `20220117141531`. `INT=0x1c` are timer interrupts (can ignore).
Looks like after int 0x1a EAX=0xbb00 (`TCG_StatusCheck`), Windows also issues
`TCG_CompactHashLogExtendEvent` after seeing TPM is present.

Now we try to modify `TCG_StatusCheck` to return `TCG_PC_TPM_NOT_PRESENT`.
