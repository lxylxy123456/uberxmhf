# Port XMHF64 back to uberXMHF repo

## Scope
* All XMHF
* Git `cb825af84`

## Behavior
I have been working on the fork <https://github.com/lxylxy123456/uberxmhf/>.
Now it's probably time to merge to <https://github.com/uberspark/uberxmhf/>.

## Debugging

### Contacting maintainers
Posted on uberXMHF's forum <https://forums.uberspark.org/t/extending/453>.

Amit proposed using the new name `xmhf-64` for code and `docs/pc-intel-x86_64`
for documentation.

### Creating PR

Going to use `uberxmhf-merge` branch for the PR.

The upstream is at tag `v6.1.0` (`3cd28bfe5`) and has not been changed for a
long time.
