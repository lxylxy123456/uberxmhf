Adding new |uberapps|
=====================

Integrating a new |uberapp| into the micro-hypervisor requires the following 
integration pieces:

1.  Create directory for |uberapp| functionality (e.g., ``xh_newapp``) within 
    the ``xmhf-uobjs`` folder

      * ``xh_newapp.gsm`` defines key attributes of the |uberapp|
      * ``xhnewapp_main.c`` is used to invoke different operations (e.g., initialize, hypercall, shutdown, etc.). Where each of these opertions has a related file (``xhnewapp_hcbinit.c``)

  
2.  To integrate the |uberapp| add references in the following locations:

      * Add ``xh_newapp`` to the list in ``xmhf-uobjs/UOBJLIST.in``
      * Add a ``DEFINE XMHFGEEC_SLAB_XH_NEWAPP`` to ``include/xmhf-config.h``
      * Add a table entry to ``static xc_hypapp_info_t _xcihub_hypapp_info_table[]`` corresponding 
        to the operations your hypapp performs in ``xmhf-uobjs/include/xc.h``
      * Add ``xh_newapp`` to the list of ``uobj-callees`` in ``xmhf-uobjs/xc_init/sc_init.gsm`` and ``xmhf-uobj/xc_ihub/xc_ihub.gsm``

    
3.  Ensure that your reconfigure prior to building (this is required to 
    rewrite ``xmhf-uobjs/UOBJLST`` that is used by the ``Makefile``). Follow the 
    steps in  :doc:`uberXMHF (pc-intel-x86_32) Veryfying and Building </pc-intel-x86_32/build/intro>`

   
4.  Add a test program that exercises your |uberapp| in ``xmhf-rgapps/linux``

      * Create a directory for the test program (``rgapp-newapp``) that includes 
        a ``Makefile`` and the testprogram (``rgapp-newapp.c``).
      * This test program will need to call ``__vmcall(eax, ebx, edx, ecx)``, 
        where ``eax`` is the hypercall ID, ``ebx`` is the high order 32-bit of the 
        physical address, ``edx`` is the low-order 32-bit of the 
        physical address (e.g., of an up to 4KB buffer being passed to the |uberapp|), 
        and ``ecx`` is variable based upon the |uberapp|.
      * This test program needs to convert the data buffer being sent to the 
        |uberapps| from a virtual to a physical address. Some approaches for 
        this (such as reading ``/proc/self/pagemap``) require root permissions.

    
5.  Run the test program (using permissions as required, see above). 

``xh_uhcalltest`` is an example |uberapp| that follows the above steps to 
demonstrate a simple hypercall handling functionality. The corresponding
rich-guest application is found within ``xmhf-rgapps/linux/rgapp-uhcalltest``.


..  note::  
    Currently, the preferred method of adding |uberapps| is to switch out an
    existing |uberapp| 
    (to preserve the memory mapping). By default the following |uberapps| are 
    enabled: ``syscalllog``, ``hyperdep``, and ``ssteptrace``.
    Thus to add a new |uberapp|, one would replace one of the above with the 
    new |uberapp|.

..  note::
    To expand the number of |uberapps| that can be enabled, the memory map must 
    be expanded. This requires changing the size within ``include/xmhf-config.h`` 
    by modifying definitions such as ``XMHFGEEC_xxx_{BASE/MAX}_IDX``; 
    and `uxmhf-common.mk.in`` by modifying exports such as ``UXMHF_TOTAL_xxSLABS``, 
    ``XMHF_CONFIG_LOADADDR``, ``XMHF_CONFIG_LOADMAXSIZE``, and ``XMHF_CONFIG_LOADMAXADDR``. 

..  note::
    The folloinwg are default naming conventions for |uobjs| within the 
    micro-hypervisor:
    * xc = uberXMHF core
    * xh = uberXMHF hypapps  
    * xg = uberXMHF Guest
